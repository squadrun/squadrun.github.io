Simple introductions are the best. Hello :)<!--more-->  
But there can be no better way to introduce SquadRun's Engineering blog than to do it with a reference to a programmer's love for learning. 

We are thankful to all the great people out there sharing their experiences and learnings. You inspire and help us daily with your content. We have saved hours of frustration and stopped ourselves from bad design numerous times because of those who faced these problems before us and were kind enough to make the knowledge public.

In the beginning, the problems we faced had easy to find solutions on the Internet. But slowly these problems changed from being easy to rare. We frequently found us designing systems for which a lot of advice wasn't available. Manier times we had to make things work by trial and error. In all this _figuring out_ we garnered a lot of knowledge that we think could benefit others like us.

On that note, it is my pleasure to announce that SquadRun Engineering will now be a more active contributor to the community's knowledge pool.

Game On!
